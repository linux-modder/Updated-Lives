This repository has pre-flattened ready to go kickstartr files (.ks) for use with livemedia-creator iso creation.  These use the ksflatten as documented here: [[ https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Livemedia-creator-_How_to_create_and_use_a_Live_CD
]] .

These are the unmodified ones used when the SIG makes the regular updated ISOs, if you wish/have a need to modify them for personal / corporate /  special project reasons, feel free to modify these.  If this is your first time or you are otherwise new to working with kickstarts, the SIG hoghly suggests l;iberal use of cp flat-${spin}.ks flat-${spin}.ks.bak and the kickstart validator [[ sudo dnf install pykickstart && ksvalidator flat-${spin}.ks ]].

ksvalidator flat-${spin}.ks will give output like this, mind you those shown here are expected as they are Deprecation Warnings NOT errors.

This script IS NOT Multi arch, it will only build x64 (64 bit) ISOs as written if you need another arch add it to teh scripting or ask a SIG member.

The script takes 2 arguments:

$1 VERSION to build for (i.e 24,25)
$2 DATE to have in the filename (i.e.  20170301 > F25-${spin}-x86_64-20170301.iso 

For any questions please reach out to the team on this Repo as a issue request, or if you are the IRC type like all team members are find us over in [[ ircs://chat.freenode.net/#fedora-respins ]]

PRs for special events, like l10n ready made KS files or Audience Specific KS Files (Events/Conferences) are welcome.  We ask that you Fork and PR hpwever as we prevent any non SIG member from direct push access.
